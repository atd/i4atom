# i4atom package

Support developer workflow and integration among [Trello](https://trello.com/),
[Github](https://github.com/) and [Slack](https://slack.com/)

This package will save you a lot of work if you use Trello cards for a scrum-like
work organization of tasks, but implement the features using Github pull requests and
communicate over Slack

* It shows all your work in progress cards, along all your boards
* It creates pull requests in one click: pushes current branch, creates the pull
  request in Github with a link to the Trello card, and adds a comment in the
  Trello card with a link to the pull request. Documentation tasks made easy!
* It shows a list of all the pull requests in every card with the following information:
  - Pull request revision status and link to the pull request
  - Continuous integration status with a link to the continuous integration url
  - Changelog entry status with a link to the `CHANGELOG.md` file
  - Button for checking out the pull request branch (easy change between cards)
  - Button for asking pull request review in Slack
* Besides the open pull request button, there are buttons for adding time information
  to the card (for time tracking), and a button for moving the card to the testing
  list
